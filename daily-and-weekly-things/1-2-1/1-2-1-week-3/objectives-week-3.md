This document contains your objectives for the Week. All Objectives should follow a [SMART](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/smart-goals/) structure. Remember, an objective can last a number of weeks if necessary!


Objective 01:

Specific:
Complete the challenges by Wednesday at 6pm. I need to be extremely strict with only allocating 20 minutes to solving each problem I'm stuck on, and at the very least, have an idea of what the problem is. The first step is to write out an overview of each problem, break each one down into small, manageable pieces, and split up the workload for the three days.

Measurable:
Based on the amount of problems broken down for each day, I will keep track of the time spent. If I go over 20 minutes on any task, I need to ask for help and move on. I will track how long it took me to solve each problem and write down the time next to each one.

Achievable:
To make this goal achievable, I will ensure that each problem is broken down into small, manageable tasks that can realistically be completed within 20 minutes. I’ll allocate 20 minutes per problem with the goal of having at least one idea or hypothesis for each issue by the end of the time limit. If I’m stuck for longer than 20 minutes, I’ll ask for help to resolve the problem.

Relevant:
This goal is relevant because I have been struggling to complete the tasks on time and allocating time towards PHP work and studying material from class/consolidating notes.

Time-bound:
I will complete all the tasks and challenges by Wednesday at 6pm. This gives me a clear deadline and allows me to prioritize my time effectively over the next three days, focusing on the most important issues first. That way I also have Thursday as a buffer day in case anything unexpected happens.
