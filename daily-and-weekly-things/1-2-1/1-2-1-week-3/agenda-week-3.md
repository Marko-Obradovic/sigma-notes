## Week 3

What went well for you this week?
- I learned how to fetch data from the internet and manipulate it to create an interface to interact with it - really enjoyed this a lot
- I was extremely comfortable breaking each problem given down - it took me a while since I'm getting used to it, but I got through every coding problem, understood where I was going wrong and what I needed to tackle in the challenges and although I didn't finish the Assessment, I'm very happy with how I approached it.

What didnâ€™t go so well this week?
- I handed in my challenge a day late
- I wasn't able to complete the technical assessment
- I felt like I was lagging behind a lot
- I struggled with time management

Feedback on your performance this week
- 

Feedback for Sigma Labs
- My only issue is that there's so many things happening that it feels like a lot of the content, which has been so thoughtfully put together and is incredibly useful is going over my head because I just need to focus on the deliverables. I do recognise this is something that may come with time as I get used to the pacing but just at the very beginning of the course I feel like it's a shame I didn't get a chance to do any of the above and beyonds, or properly sit down and study certain PHP concepts or read some books - it's great that it's all there though, like I said last week, I'm just adding all the things that I see on my to-do list and anything that I find I need more than once I'll put more time into.
