This document contains your objectives for the Week. All Objectives should follow a [SMART](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/smart-goals/) structure. Remember, an objective can last a number of weeks if necessary!


Objective 01:

- [ ] Specific: 

Organise one social event per month, check in with the quad every day from Monday to Friday. I will keep track of this in the [[organising-socials-and-calls-tracking-week-2-objective-1]] in the [objectives] folder and add to it every day.

- [ ] Measurable:

By the end of the course, host at least 3 social events, by the end of the week, check up on everyone in the quad chat 5 times.

- [ ] Achievable:

Dedicate one weekend per month for social events, allocate a half an hour call to help solve a quad mates problem.

- [ ] Relevant:

Strengthening relationships and maintaining meaningful connections is something really important to me, I want to make sure everyone has a good time and feels supported. I don't want to become complacent in this.

- [ ] Time-bound:

Starting immediately and evaluating progress at the end of each month using the file progress is tracked in.

Objective 02:

- [ ] Specific: 

For every problem I work on, start by writing down what I already know about it, create a detailed flowchart to visualise its structure, and write an algorithm in simple terms as if I were explaining it to a 5-year-old

- [ ] Measurable:

Apply this approach to the main challenge, ensuring each problem includes a written summary, a flowchart, and a simplified algorithm.

- [ ] Achievable:

*reference: [[solving-problems-summary]]*

Main challenge: Allocate 45 minutes for writing the summary and creating the flowchart, and an additional 30 minutes for crafting the simplified explanation of the algorithm.

When you're stuck, allocate 20 minutes to trying to identify the problem (reference the flow chart and algorithm) - contact a coach if it's not obvious after 20 minutes. Once found, break down the problem and for each smaller problem:

1. Read the task and write down what's already known
2. Have a look at the tests
3. Understand what the inputs and outputs are
4. Write out the simplified algorithm
5. Code to pass the tests and refine for 20 mins.

Daily coding problems: The time frame to finish is half an hour and the problems are smaller, so drawing a flow chart is unnecessary - allocate 15 minutes to the steps above, but focus on passing the tests and refine for the time remaining.

- [ ] Relevant:

This structured approach will improve my problem-solving skills, logical thinking, and ability to communicate technical concepts effectively.

- [ ] Time-bound:

Begin this process immediately. Its effectiveness is reviewed through score progression in reports and its consistency is reviewed in the [problem-summaries] folder, which will be added to daily.
