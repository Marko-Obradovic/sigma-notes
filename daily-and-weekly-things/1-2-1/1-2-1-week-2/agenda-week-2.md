## Week 2

What went well for you this week?
- I went over my goal of 70% on the assessment - I got 96.7%
- Towards the end of the week, I found it slightly easier to break down problems
- The quad leaders got into a call and we put together a framework for handling morning kick-offs.
- I stopped trying to do as much on my own and asked for help more.
- I just prioritised writing code that just works, even if the quality might not be as high.
	- This week, through Objective 02, I want to start putting time towards improving code quality at the end.
- Towards the end of the week I got down the basics of OOP, which I was struggling with a lot at the start

What didnâ€™t go so well this week?
- This week was really overwhelming - I didn't handle it well, but I would like to talk about how I can prevent myself from lagging behind as much as I did this week in the future.
	- I definitely learned a lot and this is part of the process, but at the beginning I just couldn't follow what the challenges were asking me to do a lot of the time, it felt like I had to focus on other things even when I was behind on the coding and I felt really spread thin.
- I know we're supposed to ask for help, but most of the time when I need to ask for help I can't even pinpoint what I need help with, I just feel like I need someone to walk through it with me and nudge me in the right directions while I do it. 
	- I know this isn't good and we should be really clear about the problem, but the OOP challenge got so overwhelming I didn't even know where to start looking. 
	- Looking back at it, I see it was simpler than I made it out to be - I learned that I should have just gone through the beginning and drawn it out instead of trying to keep everything in my head, trying to solve a problem without understanding or having a reference to the context it fits in.
	- Next time I start an assignment the first thing I want to do is create a diagram of the problem and its components so that I never get lost, I can always reference it and I don't have to keep all that information in my head.
- Feels like I am slowly putting less effort in social stuff - I don't want to neglect organising quad calls/check-ins and thinking about the social.

Feedback on your performance this week
- 

Feedback for Sigma Labs
- None - just want to talk about how to juggle tasks given better

Our objective(s) for the week ahead (documented in your [objectives]) 
- Organise socials, host more quad calls. 
- Write down what you know, create a flowchart to understand the problem, and explain the algorithm as if teaching a 5-year-old

Any other business?
- If you were doing this course, how would you block out your time and handle tasks given? And also fit in time for PHP, revision of material, etc.
- If I am quad leader next time, what are some examples of qualities good quad leaders had - or just in general good practices they put in place with their quads that made sure everyone was supported and having a good time?
- Should I even be putting all these extra responsibilities in front of me if I need to focus on the content first?
