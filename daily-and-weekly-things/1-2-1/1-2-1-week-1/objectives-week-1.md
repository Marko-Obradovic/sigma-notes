This document contains your objectives for the Week. All Objectives should follow a [SMART](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/smart-goals/) structure. Remember, an objective can last a number of weeks if necessary!


Objective 01:

- [ ] Specific: Break problems down in a more methodical way; take it step by step and don't rush or over-complicate the problem by trying to attempt it all at once. Even more specific: make sure you don't move onto the next part of your written out algorithm before the tests for the first part come through with no errors.
- [ ] Measurable: Get at least 70% on the next assessment. Each day before the next assessment we have problems to do which will give me an indication of if I'm making progress.
- [ ] Achievable: Do live coding practice each day for 20 minutes with the coaches to pick up on any bad habits, make notes on what they notice and tell you to improve on.
- [ ] Relevant: This will help me stay in tempo with the exercises given so that I do not fall behind.
- [ ] Time-bound: Complete the coding exercises and tests by Friday 17th at 17:30 with at least 70% on the assessment.

### Full sentences version

I need to break problems down in a more methodical way; take it step by step and don't rush or over-complicate the problem by trying to attempt it all at once. Even more specifically, I need to make sure I don't move onto the next part of your written out algorithm before the tests for the first part come through with no errors.

The goal is to get at least 70% on the next assessment. Each day before the next assessment we have problems to do which will give me an indication of if I'm making progress.

The steps I can take to achieve this is to do as much coding practice with the coaches to pick up on any bad habits, make notes on what they notice and tell you to improve on. This will help me stay in tempo with the exercises given so that I do not fall behind.

I must complete the coding exercises and tests by Friday 17th at 17:30 with at least 70% on the assessment.
