## Week 1

What went well for you this week?
- Being put under tougher time constraints makes me realise where I'm going wrong because I'm making mistakes more often in a shorter period of time.
- Generally learning a lot through the material, lots of notes on really useful things i consistently reference like 5 steps to solving any problem, understanding what's expected in a professional setting (working principles and key skills), etc.

What didnâ€™t go so well this week?
- Speed - I take too long on problems and don't prioritise well enough
- Adding on top of code that doesn't work instead of replacing and testing smaller bits of code
- Not taking a step-by-step approach - trying to solve the entire problem at once
- I should be more prepared next time I lead the kick-off, I should have had clear things to mention and a clear end.

Feedback on your performance this week
- 

Feedback for Sigma Labs
- A little more time for the workshop - I don't feel like I have enough time to cover the reading material given
- A discussion about it afterwards so we know we were in the right direction.

Our objective(s) for the week ahead (documented in your [objectives]) 
- [ ] Specific: Break problems down in a more methodical way; take it step by step and don't rush or over-complicate the problem by trying to attempt it all at once. Even more specific: make sure you don't move onto the next part of your written out algorithm before the tests for the first part come through with no errors.
- [ ] Measurable: Get at least 70% on the next assessment. Each day before the next assessment we have problems to do which will give me an indication of if I'm making progress.
- [ ] Achievable: Do live coding practice each day for 20 minutes with the coaches to pick up on any bad habits, make notes on what they notice and tell you to improve on.
- [ ] Relevant: This will help me stay in tempo with the exercises given so that I do not fall behind.
- [ ] Time-bound: Complete the coding exercises and tests by Friday 17th at 17:30 with at least 70% on the assessment.


Any other business?
- What other objectives do you think I should be focusing on from what you've seen?
- Would we be able to have regular coding interviews?
- What can we all as a group be doing to make the most out of the course and to make things easier for all the coaches
- Doctor appointment at 8:30, might be late tomorrow morning (hope this is alright to mention here)
