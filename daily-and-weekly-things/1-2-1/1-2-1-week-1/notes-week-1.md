just throw yourself into it and write code
specifically the smallest parts of a bigger problem.

dont write an algorithm for all of it, take it step by step


dont overcomplicate
don't jump the gun
mind the space
focus on the problem in front of you

share bad code that works, ask for help to make it better TWICE.

focus on non technical, week 4 and week 6

in 2 weeks ask again


socials help people be more comfortable and therefor make people ask more questions
