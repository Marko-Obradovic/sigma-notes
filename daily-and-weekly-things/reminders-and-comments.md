- ask about the idea of playing a gaming tournament and we get prizes with the money for the socials

- Chris - for the trainees coda website these are the issues:
	- [Focusses](https://coda.io/d/Trainees_dryBdidTdcn/Quads_suZ7P4K6#_lu3xWbA2)


- A little more time for the workshop - I don't feel like I have enough time to cover the reading material given
	- A discussion about it afterwards so we know we were in the right direction.


feels like this week was really overwhelming - I just couldn't follow what the challenges were asking me to do a lot of the time, it felt like I had to focus on other things even when I was behind on the coding and I felt really spread thin - We needed to to all the PHP really quickly, the DBS thing took ages because of my passport, we had a bunch of other coding things to do on top of what was due and I just couldn't keep on top of it for some reason, especially when I'm struggling with the coding so much. I don't have many breaks, I try to get in as much sleep as possible (9 hours) so that I have the energy to keep going from 6am to 8pm but it feels like I'm not using that time wisely - I know we're supposed to ask for help but most of the time when I need to ask help I can't even pinpoint what I need help with, I just want someone to walk through it with me and nudge me in the right directions while I do it but I know you guys can't do that because there are other students as well. I don't know what to do what would you do in my situation?
