- Specific
	The more specific your goal, the easier it is to determine how long it should take to complete or how to measure success.
	
	Consider the following goals:
	1. Get healthy
	3. Lose 5kg
	
	The goal to lose 5kg is more specific than to get healthy.

- Measurable
	How is the goal measured? what determines success?
	The key to measurement is that whatever way the goal is measured, it accurately reflects success.

- Actionable
	What are the actions you need to take from now until the end of the goal?
	Break down the goal into small, actionable steps

- Relevant
	A lot of the time when we set goals, we set too many and sometimes pursue the wrong goals
	A fix for this is placing goals in [[eisenhower's-matrix]] and seeing what's currently top priority. That way we know exactly why we need them and can explain why they are relevant
	Ask yourself the 80/20 rule. What are the 20% of things that would get me 80% of results

- Time-bound
	By including a date for when a specific goal should be accomplished, we provide incentive, and allows us to monitor progress.
	
	Consider the following goals:
	1. Lose 5kg
	2. Lose 5kg in 10 weeks
	
	This way, if you only lose 1 kg in 10 weeks, you know to revisit this goal and edit it.


This is to evaluate add structure to your goals
It must stay flexible, and you must set aside time to look over/re-evaluate goals
