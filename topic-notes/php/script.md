This is where I'm going to have my interview script:
**general common questions:**


### Tell me about your background.
```
So my love for technology comes from my childhood - I spent a lot of time on computers and so I got a lot of exposure from that, but during my secondary education, I actually started to develop an interest in music - and at first it was drumming and playing in bands

but the more I learned about music the more I actually found that i enjoyed producing music more than performing it

i really loved learning about the hardware and the software, the ways in which they interacted and how we can leverage them to achieve the best results for the musicians

and so I carried on with audio engineering all the way up to university where we got a lot of in-depth exposure to the technology behind everything

and actually one of the more interesting modules i did at university was looking at arduinos

and we began to build little programs on them which would allow us to use them as MIDI controllers - kind of the same way you would use a keyboard to play notes on your computer

and this really got me really interested, because I got to see what was going on under the hood - and so over time, I started tinkering with python to see what else could be done and so that I could learn more

But i realised that i was becoming more interested in the technology than i was in the music - i started to become interested in the problem solving aspects - the algorithms, the data, etc - I eventually completed a course on Udacity in Python and it was just so much fun to do.

and thats what started leading me down the path of pursuing technology not for the sake music but to learn to use code to solve problems

and so it was this really passionate interest in python which i developed that led me to look for training and that's when I found sigma labs - and I've been there for a few weeks now, and we're learning great skills in software/data engineering but also actually have a professional high performance module to learn how to be effective in the workplace - and I'm really really enjoying it - I genuinely look forward to learning more in the months to come.

### What are you looking for in your career now? (REDO)
``
```
I’m currently in the process of training under Sigma Labs, focusing on becoming a software and data engineer. In the near term, my goal is to absorb as much knowledge as possible about current technologies, best practices, and to gain a deep understanding of both the granular details and the broader picture of how systems work. I’m particularly interested in applying my skills within the fintech, AI, and sustainable resources sectors. However, I’m open to exploring other industries as well, as I’m more focused on leveraging my expertise to solve real-world problems using data and software engineering, regardless of the sector.

In the next 5 years, I see myself growing into a position where I can start building and maintaining products with my own team. I want to contribute to a company’s success while continuously learning, expanding my skill set, and evolving as an engineer. Leadership is also an important part of my vision—I’ve always thrived in environments where collaboration and teamwork are at the core. During my time at university, I led teams during recording sessions, which helped me develop strong communication, decision-making, and delegation skills. I enjoy finding creative solutions with others and pushing the boundaries of what we can accomplish as a team. I would love to apply this same collaborative mindset in a future leadership role where I can help guide others, foster innovation, and drive meaningful projects.

As I think about the future, I’m excited to learn from experienced professionals and expand my network, gaining insights from the best in the field. I love learning from others, whether it’s through mentoring, collaborating, or observing their approach to challenges. The opportunity to work alongside talented colleagues is something I’m eager to pursue, and I believe that being part of this company will offer the kind of growth, collaboration, and innovation I’m looking for.
```

### How do you communicate effectively at work? (TO DO)
```
```
Introduction: Define what effective communication means to you.
Approach: Describe your approach (e.g., active listening, being clear and concise).
Example: Give an example where this approach led to successful communication in a project or situation.
Conclusion: Conclude with how your communication skills contribute to team success.

To me, effective communication is about ensuring that ideas, goals, and feedback are conveyed clearly and efficiently, so everyone involved has a shared understanding.

My approach to effective communication is centered on active listening, clarity, and structure. I aim to tailor my message to the audience, ensuring I address their needs and priorities. A tool that I often use to enhance communication is the _hypothesis tree_ and the _MECE_ (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) framework. The hypothesis tree helps me break down complex ideas into logical components, while MECE ensures that my communication is both complete and avoids overlap. Together, these tools allow me to structure my messages in a way that is logical, clear, and actionable.

**Example**:  
In a recent project, our team was tasked with diagnosing a drop in customer satisfaction metrics. I presented potential reasons for the decline, breaking them down into manageable components. Through this we were able to systematically rule out overlaps and address each factor thoroughly. This structured approach not only made the problem easier to understand but also allowed the team to align quickly on next steps. As a result, we identified and resolved the root cause two weeks ahead of schedule.

**Conclusion**:  
By combining active listening, clarity, and structured frameworks like the hypothesis tree and MECE, I contribute to my team’s success by ensuring our communication is focused, efficient, and aligned. This approach not only improves collaboration but also drives better decision-making and outcomes.


### What makes a team successful, and how do you contribute?
I feel like a successful team
### What’s your process for tackling difficult problems?
```
I tend to tackle difficult problems using a five-step process

1) First I make sure I understand it 

2) Then I model the problem - so I think about formats I'm working with and expected outputs

3) Then I outline a simple, step by step approach

4) I'll then work through the task following that plan, but still staying flexible

5) And then go back to refine the result

And for each step I'm on, if I spend more than 20 minutes on it I ask for help and explain the issue I'm having clearly.

So, just to give you an example:

**Situation and Task:**  
At Sigma Labs, we were given a task to take flight and weather data from APIs, so external sources, process it, display it in a table on the command line, and then export the data to a file. 

And now this was a little tricky because I had just started learning APIs, and so I still didn't have a clear picture in my mind as to how all these concepts being introduced were put together.

**Action:**
And so I had to break the steps down:
- **Understand the problem**: I started by writing out what it's asking from me in my own words, asking questions and clarifying any uncertainties.
- **Model the problem**: I then figured out the formats used - as in data structures I needed - because they were formatted a certain way in the place we were getting them from.
- **Write an algorithm**: I then outlined the steps: so how to search for the airport, how to retrieve data from the external source, technologies and resources needed, etc.
- **Write tests and code**: And so then when I'm writing code - it's much easier because I already have an outline for everything I need - so it was really easy to look for specific documentation for certain problems for example.
- **Refactor and reflect**: Then finally after getting everything working, I went back, improved the code by adding better error handling and tidying and optimising the code.

And I remember specifically having issues with testing whether the data was being exported, which, after 20 minutes I ended up just asking for help and sorting it out quickly so that I could move on towards finishing the task.

**Result:**  
And so the result was a program that allowed users to search for flight data from any airport, view the most important flight and weather information, and export it out. It ended up being fully automated, super reliable, and user-friendly.

**Reflection:**  
Now this was definitely a challenging but rewarding project - I think it shows the importance of taking a step by step approach to problems so that you can break everything down into small manageable steps and prevent yourself from getting lost.

```


### How do you prioritise tasks with competing deadlines?
```
I'll start out by separating out my to-do by putting important and urgent stuff first so I only focus on them

I then use SMART goals so I can keep the objectives clear and measurable, and it really helps me stay on track and know exactly when adjustments are needed

And so for example I have to put this in practice every week at Sigma Labs which is great

**Situation and Task**:  
So this week, as with every week, I have a large coding challenge and a 40 question mastery quiz due at the same time at the end of the week - and on Wednesdays I have to deliver coursework for our professional high performance module. And so that along with classes each day, daily coding problems, agendas that need to be updated for 1-2-1's we have, I need to meet all the deadlines while making sure the quality of my work was as high as possible.


**Action**:  
So I’ve structured my time into blocks:

- On the weekend, I finish my 1-2-1 agenda, set my SMART goals for the week and finish all the work for the professional high performance module.
- So for example, this week a SMART goal I set was focusing on improving how much time I spend on a problem I'm stuck on before I ask for help - absolutely no more than 20 minutes so that I can work on moving at a consistent pace.
- During the week, I block out 6-7 hours daily for the coding challenge.
- In the evenings, I consolidate my notes, check emails, and make sure everything is organized for the next day.
- And so the goal is to finish the challenge by Wednesday evening, leaving Thursday open for buffer time in case of unexpected delays and Friday open for the quiz where I can utilise all the information I learned throughout the week to properly answer all the questions.


**Result**:  
By following this structure, I'm making steady progress on the challenge task, I completed all the other coursework, and I'll have plenty of time to do some extra learning on Thursday, all while staying on track for the Friday deadline.

**Reflection**:  
In the future, I might consider adding a bit more buffer time early in the week for unexpected issues, but this system has been effective in balancing multiple competing tasks.
```


### Tell me about your key weakness.
```
I think my key weaknesses is definitely that I tend to get too caught up in the details, especially when I’m learning something new. 

While this attention to detail can be useful, it sometimes affects my ability to move forward quickly.

**Situation:**  
And so just to give you an example, during my training at Sigma Labs, we were tasked with developing a movie rental system using Object-Oriented Programming, something I was still getting comfortable with.

**Task:**  
Unfortunately I found myself spending a lot more time on my code than I had anticipated, trying to perfect the details before moving on.

**Action:**  
I became so focused on refining my work—tweaking individual methods and trying to learn every little thing —that I ended up falling behind schedule. And so when I realised this was the case, to make sure I would stay on track, I consistently asked for feedback from my instructors when I got stuck; but sometimes it takes me some time to realise that this is happening.

**Result:**  
The delay in completing my work not only impacted my progress on the task itself but it started affecting other things I had to be doing during the week such as working on other modules. This also meant that I couldn't spend a lot of time helping my peers with their troubleshooting which is definitely something I want to be putting time into so we all learn and grow together.

**Reflection:**  
From this, I learned that while attention to detail is important, it’s equally critical to manage my time effectively and stay focused on the bigger picture. I've been working to improving my time management, setting clear deadlines for myself, and making sure I leave time for my other responsibilities, and it's helping a lot - I'm getting more great work done in a shorter amount of time.
```


### Tell me about your key strength.
My key strength is definitely my work ethic. I feel like I will always put in the hard work to get things done well, and I'm always looking for opportunities to learn and improve.
```
And so definitely a good example of this is in my second year, I was gaining studio experience by helping final-year students record their final projects. For one session, unfortunately, because of a misunderstanding, the student booked a studio that wasnt suited for traditional recording, and I wasn’t actually trained on its use. Now normally, we’d re-book or find someone trained, but there were no available engineers and studio booking restrictions were in place

---

**T (Task):**  
Because this was such an important session for their degree, I needed to make sure the recording session went smoothly and the outcome was exactly what they needed.

---

**A (Action):**  

My first course of action was just to read through the manual for the console and use the room during small gaps inbetween bookings to get some hands on practice. I actually ended up arranging a call with the lecturer that specialised in that equipment to just run me through the studio specifications and guide me on how to effectively operate the room for this kind of session; and so then I communicated everything with the student and we put together a session plan we could use.
---

**R (Result):**  
Now there were definitely challenges during the session, but I was able to troubleshoot technical issues quickly because I actually understood how the equipment interacted. And The result was excellent, they got a very high grade and the student was extremely happy with the result. In the end, the student actually became a regular client and I received a lot of direct messages from students asking to book in sessions with me which gave me tons of experience.

---

**R (Reflection):**  
And I feel like I'm really glad I worked hard to understand the equipment, I learned how that studio works and I'm extremely happy with the creative solutions we put in place to meet the needs of the project. And I’m confident that I can bring this same level of dedication and problem-solving to future challenges in a professional setting.
```

STORY:
so I was getting some experience in my first year and answering emails from students that needed their final projects for their degree recorded
They have to be the ones that book the studio due to uni rules, and so they booked it out before sending the message - in the message they said what day it was and if anyone was free (i was in that case) someone would come and take it.
Issue is, they accidentally picked the worst possible studio. You have two studios for recording drums, guitar, piano, vocals etc - these have a really nice SSL origin analogue desk and lovely outboard gear like 1167 and LA2A, lexicon reverb - perfection. They picked the one which didn't have a desk for recording - it looked like it but it was a controller for protools.  the only thing we had were confusingly set up preamps that we could connect the microphones through to the other room via tie lines and this room had the worst drum kit in the university. 
Also thing is, this was a dolby atmos room it wasn't meant for actually mixing properly or anything like that and what didnt help was i wasnt trained in it, and it keeps getting changed so much that the facilities staff had no clue how to trouble shoot. 
In normal circumstances we should have re-booked but the nature of booking studio sessions was that you can't book more than 2 weeks in advance and the issue was that in two weeks, the audio engineering students would have blocked out sessions made by teachers made two months in advance, so the studios were not accessible to any other students. 
so what i had to do was then prepare for the next two weeks - I learned how to use the console, read the manual, asked the IT team for guideance on how the studio was set up, and then emailed the atmos tutor so I could get into a call with him to discuss how to effectively operate the studio in this scenario.
I also had to email facilities to book in a better drum kit to record and finally created a final patch plan, mic list, and got the protools session ready. 

the session definitely had a few issues but because I understood the signal flow of all the gear and how the desk worked, I could very easily troubleshoot anything that happened. the outcome was incredible, they were extremely happy and actually became a regular client later on. After that I got a lot of direct messages to ask me to record people and as far as I know the person who the project was for got the highest score in her class
