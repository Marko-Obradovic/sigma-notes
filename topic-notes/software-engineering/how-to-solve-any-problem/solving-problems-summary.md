Main challenge: Allocate 45 minutes for writing the summary and creating the flowchart, and an additional 30 minutes for crafting the simplified explanation of the algorithm.

When you're stuck, allocate 20 minutes to trying to identify the problem (reference the flow chart and algorithm) - contact a coach if it's not obvious after 20 minutes. Once found, break down the problem and for each smaller problem:

1. Read the task and write down what's already known
2. Have a look at the tests
3. Understand what the inputs and outputs are
4. Write out the simplified algorithm
5. Code to pass the tests and refine for 20 mins.

Daily coding problems: The time frame to finish is half an hour and the problems are smaller, so drawing a flow chart is unnecessary - allocate 15 minutes to the steps above, but focus on passing the tests and refine for the time remaining.
