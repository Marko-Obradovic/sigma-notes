4 fundamental comcepts of OOP:
- Abstraction
	- simplify reality
	- only concern yourself with data and processes relevant to the application being built
- Encapsulation
	- Data and the programs that manipulate those data are bound together and their complexity is hidden
	- simpler explanation: hiding away details inside class
- Inheritance
	- A class can derive methods and properties from another class, resulting in a hierarchy of classes
- Polymorphism
	- Different subclasses of the same superclass, can implement their shared interface in different ways

Object is a thing from the real world

can be tangible or non tangible

a thing that you want to store and process data about

alternative name for object: entity

to create an object you write a class.

attributes/fields/properties describe the object
	coded within the class as public variables or property procedures

methods/operations/behaviours
	actions that can be done to or performed by the object
	coded either as procedures or functions

class is a template for creating an object.

you can create multiple objects from one class.

each object is an instance of a class in the computers memory.

creating an object from a class is called instantiation

once these objects have been created, their properties can have be assigned values


...finish later from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_MQYyJpIjg&t=541s)


in objects, you want a getter and setter:
	def get_name that returns the self.name
	set set_name that changes the name
	- basically make a nice interface

look into private, protected and public variables
	Private Variable: Force to not used
	Protected Variables: Suggested not used
	Public Variable: Go for it



look into:
- regular methods, class methods and static methods
- abstract classes and abstract methods


look into: 
- State diagram
- composition/association in oop
