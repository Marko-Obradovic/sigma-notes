clear unused variables

use good function names - if you can't come up with a good one, ask yourself if the function has a good crisp focus? if not, it needs to be refactored

make good variable names - try to imagine you're reading the code again in the future and you forgot exactly how it works. Ask yourself if the variable names help explain what the code is supposed to do

use consistent code conventions:
I use snake_case

Avoid short names

describe what the variable/function/class does in the name

parameters of functions and classes should also have names that properly represent what will be received into it

JS SPECIFIC:
do not use var, use let and const for their purpose (var is for changeable const is for non-changeable)


Don't repeat yourself
