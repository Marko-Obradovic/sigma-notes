**Two Minute Rule:** Keep answers within two minutes
	UNLESS: double-loaded question ("Tell me about your strengths AND weaknesses.")

**Work chronologically:** e.g ("Tell me more about your background") answer should be chronological
	For these questions also only focus on the relevant details, not your life story.
	- Passion for coding/tech/data
	- Uni studies

	- Tell me about your background.
	- What are you looking for in your career now?
	- What are your main strengths and weaknesses?
	- How do you communicate effectively at work?
	- What makes a team successful, and how do you contribute?
	- Whatâ€™s your process for tackling difficult problems?
	- How do you prioritise tasks with competing deadlines?

# Analysing A Company And Job
For the company, invest at least 3-4 hours researching them thoroughly. Look for at least 3 things that genuinely excite you, such as:
- Their company mission and values
- The technologies they use
- Recent successful client work or publications
- Their commitment to causes that matter to you (e.g. sustainability, charity)
- Positive employee reviews on Glassdoor
- Recent positive media coverage or social media posts


framework for research:
Find company mission and values, write down things it looks like they focus on (innovation, business growth, sustainability, etc).
