Walmart's investment in data analytics and supply chain technology has significantly improved its operations and financial performance.

They are introducing five new automated distribution centres to double inventory capacity and manage over 50% of their products by 2026. These centres use robotics to optimise store-specific pallet building, increasing efficiency and reducing costs.

Walmart is also automating 400 pickup and delivery centres with AI, improving order fulfilment speed and accuracy. This has helped expand same-day delivery to 93% of U.S. households (up from 80% in 2023), reaching 12 million more homes.

As a result, Walmart's annual sales reached $681 billion, with a $121 billion revenue increase over four years, demonstrating the significant impact of these advancements.

Although Team Poseidon gave effective use cases for the system, they mainly focused on the system's practical applications rather than the commercial value.

They mention that it could be used for education and individually for people living in areas that are prone to earthquakes, but they could have focused on monetisation options or models, such as subscriptions. For example, they could have a personal subscription and a business subscription for schools or other businesses that want to utilise it in different ways.

Since they position the system as an invaluable tool for industries that need earthquake data, such as property development, it could have also been beneficial to highlight how the system helps businesses save money by being better prepared for earthquakes.

By tying financial benefits to these features, they would make a stronger case to stakeholders about the project's commercial potential.
