We could be asking if the information we're trying to pull out of the data is relevant and useful to the current situation; we don't want to be spending time trying to assess data that doesn't align with the specific objectives or goals we are trying to achieve.

looking at the post-redesign metrics, there's a trend: each week, on average, the user count is dropping by about 1,250, purchases are decreasing by 150, the average purchasing value is decreasing by Â£2 and the bounce rate is increasing by 1.6%. These trends suggest that the redesign may not have achieved its goal of improving user experience.

The main issue here seems to be conversion - although a decrease in user count could indicate a lower interest in the brand, if we think about the Pareto Principle (80% of purchases are most likely coming from 20% of users), if in the end we had the same amount of purchases with a lower user count, user count would not be a problem

And so because purchases are disproportionately dropping in contrast to user count, it may be worth considering the bounce rate at this stage, which seems to be affecting the likeliness that someone landing on the website will buy something, decreasing purchases and lowering conversion.

The bounce rate has been evaluated as a site usability/user experience issue and so it seems that if it's not addressed, the bounce rate will keep increasing at least in the near future, lowering both the purchases made and user count.

Eventually, the bounce rate may decrease when users that are used to the website layout become the majority. This decrease is not an indication of progress, because eventually when the user count and purchases made begin to stay stagnant, it would indicate that conversion has settled at a lower number, especially since there is no clear reason for the purchase amount nor the average purchasing value to increase.

In the end, you may have a low bounce rate, but low purchases and user counts.

	We can observe that the credit card transactions fail 87.5% of the time because the payment provider status is down each time it fails.
