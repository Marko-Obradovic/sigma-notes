So I'm going to be recording the process of me doing Tuesday's problem for Week 3, so the task is: Count the number of duplicates I need to write a function that will return the count of distinct case insensitive alphanumeric characters and numeric digits that occur more than once in the input string. The input string can be assumed to contain only alphabets, both uppercase and lowercase, and numeric digits. For example, ABCD E would return 0 because no characters repeat more than once. A ABBCDE. Would return 2. A and B. So. First of all. Into distinguish. What the out inputs and outputs are. Inputs. O we need. Alphabetic. Character. OK, so we need a string. With. Letters and numbers. And without putting. We're returning. An. That represents. Pound. Case insensitive. Letters and numbers. So. Now, if I were to explain this problem to. Five year old. I would say. I need. So I would be going through the list first. As in iterate. Through the list. And. I would. Create a set of all of these characters. But now that I'm thinking about it. The dictionary might be better because. I need. To count. Actually no I can store. I can have a separate dictionary for. Counting alphabetic characters and so in in that for loop I can say if it's alphabetic. Update the is alpha, let's say. Dictionary key. Or the the value of of that key and same for numeric digits. So first I would. 1st I want to make it so that they're all unique, so the easiest way to. That would be. A set I assume. Actually what I could do is before even going through the list and actually it wouldn't be a list in this case it would be. A set. But first I would say. The. List to a set. To make sure all. Items. Uh, sorry to make sure only unique items are in the list. And I know actually that it's asking me. To make it all case insensitive. So. What I could do is. Just before I convert that list. I can. I can make the string lower. Convert string to. A lower version. All of that string. And then and actually I made a mistake here, but it's not a list. Just convert the string to a set to make sure only unique items are in the list. And so OK, just to reiterate. I'm converting the string to a lower version of that string. I convert the string to a set to make sure only unique items are in the list. And that would also remove the. Case sensitivity. So everything would be lower case. I just want to test check the tests. Just so that I make sure that that's actually what? They are asking for. All right, so. So then I'm going through the set, so I'm iterating through the set and. I made a mistake in the output. Actually, no, I I didn't. I I made a mistake earlier saying that I need to. Create a dictionary. I don't need to create a dictionary every time it loops through one of those characters. It is a distinct case insensitive alphanumeric character or a numeric digit. So I would just need to. Increase the count which I can set up as a variable and then return that count. Set increase. Count. By 1. Or even better. I could make count the length of. The set. Make the variable count the length. Return that return count. OK, so that should work. I'm just going to. Copy that into. Where it needs to be. So first we're going to convert the string to a lower version of the string, so it would be text dot lower or I would say them to variable so. Low case text. Text dot lower and I'm just going to print low case text so that I can see what's happening. I'm going to. I'm going to. Certificate count with a string. Hello. Or other. Let me get one. The tests. Might be more useful. None. OK, so that works. I'm just going to put some numbers. OK, great. So nothing happens. There are numbers. So the next thing would be to convert the string to a. So I would just say. And actually, I'm going to change. The low case text variable to low case. String. Or rather low case message. And then I'm going to. Say. Unique. Message. Actors equals. Locate message. Actually. Equals. Character. For character. Low case message so that it actually gets us a set. And I'm just going to print unique. Characters to see if it's. Working and that's all working completely fine. O there's no. Yeah, there's no duplicate of a, which is. So just to be clear for the transcript. I'm calling duplicate count which has all of this code in it and I and the argument for for the parameter text is. A BCDEA capital B for you. And all of it has been converted. To lowercase and made unique. The set. So. I'm just going to. Make the variable count the length of the set. I'm going to say. Character count 1 minute character count equals. Let's say I. Length of the unit. Message characters. And then I'm going to return. Character count and. Print the result. Of duplicate count now because I'm returning. And I get 7, so I get. 23456. 7. 234. 567. Yeah, that's. So OK, Now what should happen is. Fire run tie test. SO22 have passed, so that's the first step. Of the way. We're just going to. See the 1st test so. A BCDE. So the test. Go to it. A basic test. Two says that dulicate count abcde should. Equal. 0. Could be. Misunderstanding. OK, I misunderstood. So it's actually asking for the amount of times that repetitions do happen. So. I would need to loop through them 0. They can't just create. So, OK, I'm going to go back to. The algorithm so I'm converting so I do still need to convert the string to a lower version of the string. I'm wondering if there's a way to. See if. You can return all of the. Values that oh, sorry all of the items that were removed from. In the conversion of the. The string. Actually just say O where I'm creating a set. I could say if. OK, so this actually wouldn't work as a set comprehension. I would have to. Create a. Traditional for loop, so I would go for character in low. Paste message. And then we can go. If character not in. Unique message characters. Unique message characters don't append. Character. I'm sorry. No, that wouldn't be it. If the character isn't in any characters. Actually I would need to append regardless it it doesn't. That part doesn't actually matter, but if it's not in uni. It is. Sorry. Then I would. Update. A new variable now called repeat character count. It's initially going to be 0, so it's not going to. The length. Of unique message characters anymore like character count was and I'm just going to put. Repeat characc count plus equals 1 and now. Addict object has no attribute append so. Yeah, of course. Sets don't have a pen, so I would. I'm wondering can. Make. So I'll actually enumerate it. I think that that's going to work and then I'm going as in enumerate the four loop. And that way. I can reference the. Number at which it's at which? We're currently at and make the repeat character count. Sorry, the unique message character. Oh, but there is no. OK, set. Don't have. Sets are unordered, so they don't have positions. Maybe a dictionary was the right thing to do. I'm just going to check the documentation to see how how you add to a set. OK, I can't quite find it in the Python documentation. I'm just going to ask. ChatGPT, So what? Method allows me to add to a set. And typing. Add OK. OK, great. So actually it would be instead of append. It's. Add. And. OK, I have to get to a call now, so I'll continue this later, but. I'm going to put this on chat GTA. And transcribe it. Summarise it. See where I could have gone better.
