You will also be able to create a UKVI account if you have lost your BRP, and have no valid ID document    If you have indefinite leave to enter or remain (also known as settlement) and prove your rights with a passport vignette sticker or ‘wet ink stamp’, you are encouraged to make a ‘No Time Limit’ application. This is a free service and once your NTL application is considered, you will receive an eVisa.    [Find out how to create a UKVI account to access your eVisa](https://www.gov.uk/get-access-evisa/check-access-your-evisa)
