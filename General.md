 no type hints

no if __name__ == main

functions, variables and parameters are badly named and unclear (gen_wor, wlist, i)

no docstrings


constant variables should ALWAYS be global, never in a function

bring up the const global variables breaking SoC

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
type hints
no magic numbers
good variable names


we're writing procedural code
- no rigid structure to it

other types:
OOP

functional programming


map function in python:


lay out steps: 
write code that works
clean code (good abstraction)
its tested
its performant (fast)




gonna use dictionaries for first assessment
